# Time-Series
This focuses on forecasting future exchange rates using historical data from exchange_rate.csv through ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques.

This Includes:

Data Preparation & Exploration: Load and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the time series.

ARIMA Modeling: Select parameters using ACF and PACF plots, fit the ARIMA model, analyze residuals, and perform out-of-sample forecasting.

Exponential Smoothing Modeling: Choose the appropriate model (Simple, Holtâ€™s Linear, or Holt-Winters), optimize parameters, fit the model, and forecast future values.

Evaluation & Comparison: Assess forecasts using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, compare model performance, and discuss advantages and limitations.

Insights & Conclusion: Summarize findings and identify the best-performing forecasting model for the dataset.
